            Happy Valentine's Day!

          <p>
            It's hard to believe that this is already the third valentine's day we've spent together. Time flies 
            when you are with your favorite person. You've made every moment of my life special, and I'm so grateful
            and lucky to have you in my life.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to spend every valentine's day, every birthday, every holiday together with you for the rest of my life. 
            I'm proud of everything that you do, you're smart, pretty, funnier than me, and all around the best girlfriend I could have 
            ever asked for. Thank you for everything, I love you so much.
          </p>
