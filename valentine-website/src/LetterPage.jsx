            From the moment I met you, my world became brighter and more beautiful.
            Every day with you feels like a gift, and I cherish every moment we share together.
          </p>

          <p>
            You make me laugh when I'm down, you inspire me to be better, and you love me
            unconditionally. Your smile lights up my darkest days, and your love gives me
            strength I never knew I had.
          </p>

          <p>
            I want to spend every Valentine's Day, every holiday, every ordinary Tuesday,
            and every extraordinary moment with you. You are my best friend, my partner,
            and the love of my life.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for saying yes. Thank you for being you. Thank you for choosing me.
          </p>

            Forever yours,<br />
            Your Valentine
